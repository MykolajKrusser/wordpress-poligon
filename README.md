# Recruitment test


### Installing

After copying from repository,
in parent folder for node dependencies:

```
npm install
```

## Running the dev mode

I use webpack as a compiler:

```
npm run start
```

The link in the browser should be here:

```
http://localhost:8080/
```

## Deployment

When you run the `npm run build` command, the project will also be built, but final already (with optimization, minimizing the file as much as possible), which you can upload to the hosting.

```
npm run build
```

The compiled project is in the `dist` folder.
